# Task Number-2: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

This project demonstrates how to generate high-quality images using pre-trained generative models such as Stable Diffusion or DALLÂ·E. These models are trained on large-scale image-text datasets and can produce realistic and creative images based on natural language prompts.

## Repository Features

The repository includes:

1. Setup and installation instructions for image generation libraries (e.g., `diffusers`, `transformers`, or `stability-sdk`).
2. Scripts to load and use pre-trained models for text-to-image generation.
3. Examples of image generation from various textual prompts.
4. Support for custom prompt input and configurable parameters like guidance scale and image resolution.
5. Optional support for saving and displaying generated images.

## Use Cases

- Art and concept design  
- Visual storytelling  
- Product mockups and UI prototypes  
- Creative content generation for blogs, social media, and games

## Purpose

This project helps explore how advanced generative models can turn text into visuals, making AI a powerful tool for designers, artists, and developers. It leverages Python along with the Hugging Face `diffusers` or similar libraries to demonstrate text-to-image capabilities.
